# Cake Sprinkles Kata 🎂 💖

### 💡 Plan: 
- My first idea was a function that takes in a number and lets you know if the number is divisible by another number   
- I began by setting up my project and planning my kata. I decided to create a function that takes in a number and lets you know if it is divisible by two numbers, or just one, or none at all. This was my MVP, and once I completed this I made sure the test will account for invalid inputs
- I kept my kata very simple, and created a lot of test cases to check the function. I was happy with how it went. Most of the code was straightforward, and I used the Coach Bot for help with some of the positive integer code in the function 

### 🍰 Cake Story: 

You are a cake decorator, and have a very superstitous client. The client wants to order a number of cakes with sprinkles for a large party they are throwing. The client requested that the number of sprinkles on the cakes should ideally be divisible by both 7 and 3, as these are the client's lucky numbers. The client would also accept a sprinkle count divisible by either 7 OR 3. Write a function that will take in the number of sprinkles and let you know if it fits the client's requirements. Your function responses should mirror responses in the test cases, and your implementation should handle positive integers

## ⭐️ Installation 
- After cloning and navigating to the folder, run 'npm install' to get the dependencies. To run the tests = 'npm run test'
