// Story 
// üç∞ You are a cake decorator, and have a very superstitous client. 
// The client wants to order a number of cakes with sprinkles for a large party they are throwing. 
// The client requested that the number of sprinkles on the cakes should ideally be divisible by both 7 and 3, as these are the client's lucky numbers. 
// The client would also accept a sprinkle count divisible by either 7 OR 3. 

// Main task 
// Write a function that will take in the number of sprinkles and let you know if it fits the client's requirements. 
// Your function responses should mirror responses in the test cases, and your implementation should handle positive integers

// Skeleton function
export function calculateSprinkles(number) {
    // Happy coding! 
}
